              KCHEF focuses on Kasese and the Rwenzori district of southwestern Uganda. Although a community of extreme poverty, it holds extraordinary resilience and promise for a future in local leadership who believe in and meet high standards for transparency and competence in health and education services.

              KCHEF (formerly the Bishop Masereka Christian Foundation) is a collaboration of Ugandans and U.S. supporters to develop and achieve self-sufficiency. As a locally-led organization, KCHEF represents the single most effective way to empower a community in a region severely impacted by conflict, disease, and extreme poverty.
