# We Can All Make a Difference in Kasese, Uganda

The Rwenzori region of Uganda is known for its natural beauty, wildlife, and one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. Making motherhood safer region by region is the most effective step we can take to eradicate extreme poverty. It is within our reach and each of us can do our part.

_The KCHEF Medical Center_ cares for over 25,000 women and their families each year. The midwives and physicians of the clinic—all drawn from the local community—provide prenatal care, skilled assistance during childbirth, emergency surgical deliveries, infant vaccinations, and prevention of mother-to child transmission of HIV. Keeping the doors of our clinic open to every mother seeking health care for herself and her children depends on the donations of our global family of supporters.

The goal of the _KCHEF Education Program_ is simple and bold: to give children at very high risk a path toward a future where they can support themselves and their families, and make a positive contribution to their community. Currently there are over 250 students enrolled in the KCHEF (Kasese Community Health & Education Foundation) education program in Uganda. An amazing fact to consider: thus far, over 200 students have made their way through the program to graduate from university, vocational or other advanced technical training. KCHEF pools donor contributions and partners with local educators and health care leader to deliver the education program and services that are unique to each child’s circumstances, and to ensure more children benefit.

KCHEF’s partnership with Community Health and Education for Rural Africa, Inc. (CHERA) ensures your tax deductible donation provides medical care and education support for our programs in Kasese, Uganda.
