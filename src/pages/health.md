        With a highly qualified, locally-led medical team, KCHEF attends to up to 2000 patients every month, and treated over 20,000 people since 2012. With a focus on maternal-infant care, the clinic provides skilled assistance during childbirth, including surgical delivery and obstetric emergency care, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), care for newborns (including premature and SGA infants), infant immunization, treatment for malaria, contraception, and HIV/AIDS testing, counseling and treatment, HIV prevention education in the community, and urgent care for all.

        KCHEF contains the only operating theatre in the area. KCHEF lab technicians deliver test results unavailable anywhere else in the region. The clinic includes an ultra sound scanner and radiology services. KCHEF is considered a center of excellence, providing the best care available in Kasese and regularly receiving referrals from other health facilities.
